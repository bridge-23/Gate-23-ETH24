Bridge23 is a platform that allows users to sell their data directly to merchants.  Customers scan their receipts and then decide which informatoin to share with merchants. 

Our new Point of Sale Dapp, Gate23, removes the extra step of scanning your recipets.   It automatically uplaods detailed line item purchase information directly to users' Bridge23 accounts so they can organize and sell their data more efficiently.  More precise data = more value for users AND merchants.  And a decentralized platform builds more trust as well.  

Unlike legacy POS models, our Dapp loads directly onto tablets.  And unlike other POS systems, which save data into nearly a dozen different databases, our data is streamlined into one crosschain NFT-based platform, built on ICP. 

This allows users to provide more and better data to merchants, which earns them more money AND customized discounts from their farvorite merchants.  Our Gate23 software streamlines this process and is a win-win for customers and sellers alike.
